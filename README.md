This is my portfolio for advanced GIS class

# about me 

  I'm an aspiring economic development professional interested in small businesses and affordable housing. Visualizing these topics through maps is very handy, not only for my own sake, but for providing visuals to communities. I grew up in Pittsburgh and am particularly interested in postindustial economies and creating twenty-first century solutions for left-behind places. Given these interests I rely on mapping often but rarely inherit ready-to-use-data. I am eager to increase my mapping abilities so i can bring some capacity to places that could benefit strategic planning. Past mapping experiences for nonprofits include: highlighting community centers and their proximity to other ammentities, indentifying the condition of housing stock in focus neighborhoods, and, most recently, mapping the downtown business invetory for a small town for my captson project.\
  I am currently interviewing and seeking job opportunities where I can apply these skills regularly.  When I'm not behind a computer screen I am often working on home improvement projects or playing with my cat Ignatius. I bought a house in Pittsburgh's Bloomfield neighborhood last spring and am currently re-doing the backyard. I even used GIS and other mapping tools to plan out a better drainage system! I have been passing time during the pandemic by sewing, doing lots of puzzles, and reading mystery novels. 

# what I hope to learn

  I am hoping to learn how to apply mapping skills beyond basic renderings. This includes learning about ESRI alternatives including Google and QGIS. I anticipate working for nonprofits or in the public sector and already experienced that licences can be hard to come by. I am also hoping to just become more confident in my map making abilites. When working at the community level I often rely on home-made data files. Sometimes I can get tripped up or delayes in geocoding and bringing this data to the visualization phase.\
  
  In terms of visualizations, I would also like to produce a more professional looking product. As is, my maps tend to look a little elementary and very purple. I would like to better hone the finishing elements of map creation as well as learn more about complementary color tools to assure my maps are not overwhemlingly purple. Like I have been able to hone in my writing style over time, I would like to use this as an opportunity to take greater control over my design skill, especially in mapping.
