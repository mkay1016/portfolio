While I've learned to never really trust self-proclaimed user-friendly tools, I found Insights lived up to the promise. After just the opioid investigation and tutorial I feel comfortable beginning to use this tool for other projects. As someone who benefits from the spatial depiction of data - otherwise my eyes can glaze over at spreadsheets – Insight’s presentation of different data visualizations is appealing and looks more comprehensive than combining maps and charts from several different sources. Dashboards seem to be growing in popularity across industries, as presenting data in this integrated manner provides a synthesized summary for managers. However, I do not have enough experience with Tableau to thoroughly compare the two. My presentation (Links to an external site.)  discussion considers the comparison between Pro and Insights in depth.

When it comes to deciding whether to use ArcGIS Pro or Insights (assuming access to both) I will likely decide based on the size and scope of the project, the depth of layers and spatial analysis necessary, the deadline, and the expected deliverable. For instance, for an interview I was recently asked to do a cursory study of employment trends across Allegheny County municipalities. As charts and graphs were necessary in addition to a map, Insights would be the better fit as the objective was to produce high-level takeaways. Also, the automatic linking feature, as used to display the pathway of opioids from distributers and pharmacies, is major benefit of Insights.

This feature could also work in the above case, displaying movement of jobs or people, especially on a local level like a county as seen in Mingo.

   However, if I was considering industry clusters on a larger scale or the deliverable was all spatial, such as kernel densities or heat maps I’d likely stick with ArcGIS Pro. As I work around the urban Planning world, Pro is still attractive as it is industry standard and shared with other map geeks. For instance, for my systems project a few of us each made independent layers (businesses, parcel outlines, parking) and are combining them into one major map in Pro. While perhaps less client ready than an Insights equivalent, it has been very useful for us to analyze the relationships between each of these large features.

   Performing the opioid and refugee analysis revealed several lessons. In the case of the opioids, comparing the populations to the dosage unit was startling and suggests over-prescription was targeted. Also, on the user error side, I was reminded how addresses alone are a difficult pathway to mapping. I forgot to scroll down and include the city, county, and zip details on one round of enabling location and got a bunch of points in Hawaii which seemed liked a farfetched connection to small county in West Virginia. Because they were! Throwing random addresses at even a smart tool like Insights can turn up anywhere without more information during the geocoding process. The opioid exercise showed the advantages of Insights on small geographies, such as single county, as well as using just a layer or two.

  The tutorial content was very instructive, but perhaps the biggest takeaway revolved around displaying data over time. This is something I previously struggled with in Pro, as without animating a map, overtime analysis can be difficult to visualize and becomes a series a of repetitive maps. The live functionality of filtering by year, or country for that matter, is a real advantage. In this way, Insights can serve as a living or long-term approach to solutions.
